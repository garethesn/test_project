Here's another test file. It contains 1 line.
File is staged, but not committed.
I've added lines 2 and 3 while the file was staged but not committed.
On branch showfiles, I've added some content to the middle of this file.
I'm going to have to merge this as I flatten the showfiles branch onto the master branch.
On branch master, I've added a few more lines to this file.
It's coming along nicely, don't you think.
I'll add one more line to this file right here, for good luck. Hurrah!
