# test_project
A test project for testing github.

Note that this will surely contain many interesting things. Many!

## Important disclaimer
* It also contains many uninteresting things, like this piss-poor documentation that masquerades as a README.md file.

## Using this repo
You should run the `init.sh` command to download useful test data.
