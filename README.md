# test_project
A test project for testing github.

Note that this will surely contain many interesting things. Many!

## Important disclaimer
* It also contains many uninteresting things, like this piss-poor documentation that masquerades as a README.md file.
* **Note to self:** *Add learning how to write competent documentation in README.md markup/markdown format as an issue.*
